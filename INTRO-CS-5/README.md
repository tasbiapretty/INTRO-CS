# INTRO-CS-5 -  Terminal Fundamentals 

Hello! I'm so glad you've made it. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Mr. Wanston. I am the Ringmaster of this Traveling Circus. I called you to help because someone has let all my animals loose into the circus during my last show! I can't seem to find any of them and I need them all in the SHOW ROOM in time for the next show. 

I was informed that you've been learning how to use 'cd' and 'ls' effectively - so you should be able to do this job, no problem!

1. Download the folders of this repository.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the repository.

3. Enter the tent and start moving any animals you can find into the show room! 

Hello world!
